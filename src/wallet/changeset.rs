/// A change set for [`Wallet`]
///
/// ## Definition
///
/// The change set is responsible for transmiting data between the persistent storage layer and the
/// core library components. Specifically, it serves two primary functions:
///
/// 1) Recording incremental changes to the in-memory representation that need to be persisted to
///    disk
/// 2) Applying aggregate changes from the persistence layer to the in-memory representation at
///    startup
///
/// ## Contract
///
/// The change set maintains and enforces the following properties:
///
/// * Change sets must implement [`Serialize`] and [`Deserialize`] to meet the definition from
///   above.
/// * Change sets must implement [`Default`] as a way of instantiating new empty objects.
/// * Change sets must implement [`Merge`] so that many instances can be aggregated into a single
///   instance.
/// * A change set is composed of a number of individual "sub-change sets" that adhere to the same
///   rules as above. This is for increased modularity and portability. For example the core modules
///   each have their own change set (`tx_graph`, `local_chain`, etc).
///
/// ## Members and required fields
///
/// The change set has certain required fields without which a `Wallet` cannot function.
/// These include the [`descriptor`] and the [`network`] in use. These are required to be non-empty
/// *in the aggregate*, meaning the field must be present and non-null in the union of all
/// persisted changes, but may be empty in any one change set, where "empty" is defined by the
/// [`Merge`](Merge::is_empty) implementation of that change set. This requirement also applies to
/// the [`local_chain`] field in that the aggregate change set must include a genesis block.
///
/// For example, the descriptor and network are present in the first change set after wallet
/// creation, but are usually omitted in subsequent updates, as they are not permitted to change
/// at any point thereafter.
///
/// Other fields of the change set are not required to be non-empty, that is they may be empty even
/// in the aggregate. However in practice they should contain the data needed to recover a wallet
/// state between sessions. These include:
/// * [`tx_graph`](Self::tx_graph)
/// * [`indexer`](Self::indexer)
///
/// The [`change_descriptor`] is special in that its presence is optional, however the value of the
/// change descriptor should be defined at wallet creation time and respected for the life of the
/// wallet, meaning that if a change descriptor is originally defined, it must also be present in
/// the aggregate change set.
///
/// ## Staging
///
/// For greater efficiency the [`Wallet`] is able to *stage* the to-be-persisted changes. Many
/// operations result in staged changes which require persistence on the part of the user. These
/// include address revelation, applying an [`Update`], and introducing transactions and chain
/// data to the wallet. To get the staged changes see [`Wallet::staged`] and similar methods. Once
/// the changes are committed to the persistence layer the contents of the stage should be
/// discarded.
///
/// Users should persist early and often generally speaking, however in principle there is no
/// limit to the number or type of changes that can be staged prior to persisting or the order in
/// which they're staged. This is because change sets are designed to be [merged]. The change
/// that is ultimately persisted will encompass the combined effect of each change individually.
///
/// ## Extensibility
///
/// Existing fields may be extended in the future with additional sub-fields. New top-level fields
/// are likely to be added as new features and core components are implemented. Existing fields may
/// be removed in future versions of the library.
///
/// The authors reserve the right to make breaking changes to the [`ChangeSet`] structure in
/// a major version release. API changes affecting the types of data persisted will display
/// prominently in the release notes. Users are advised to look for such changes and update their
/// application accordingly.
///
/// The resulting interface is designed to give the user more control of what to persist and when
/// to persist it. Custom implementations should consider and account for the possibility of
/// partial or repeat writes, the atomicity of persistence operations, and the order of reads and
/// writes among the fields of the change set. BDK comes with support for [SQLite] that handles
/// the details for you and is recommended for many users. If implementing your own persistence,
/// please refer to the documentation for [`WalletPersister`] and [`PersistedWallet`] for more
/// information.

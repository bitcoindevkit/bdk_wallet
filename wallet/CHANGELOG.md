## [v1.0.0-alpha.12]

**NOTE: The wallet API library up to tag `1.0.0-alpha.11` uses the crate name `bdk`. The `1.0.0-alpha.12` tag and later use `bdk_wallet` as the crate name.**

### Summary

This bi-weekly release fixes an electrum syncing bug when calculating fees and adds the bdk_sqlite crate for storing wallet data in a SQLite tables. The Wallet::allow_shrinking function was also remove because it was too easy to misuse. Also the `bdk` crate was renamed to `bdk_wallet`. See the changelog for all the details.

- Update bdk_electrum crate to use sync/full-scan structs #1403
- Update keychain::Balance to use bitcoin::Amount #1411
- Change `bdk_testenv` to re-export internally used crates. #1414
- Updated documentation for `full_scan` and `sync` in `bdk_esplora`. #1427

## [v1.0.0-alpha.10]

### Summary

This incremental bi-weekly release improves the address API, simplifies the Esplora API, and introduced new structures for spk-based scanning that will enable easier syncing with electrum/esplora. It also introduces a new bdk-persist crate, removes the generic T from the Wallet, and makes KeychainTxOutIndex more range based.

### Fixed
- Enable blocking-https-rustls feature on esplora client https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/pull/1408

### Changed

- KeychainTxOutIndex methods modified to take ranges of keychains instead. https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/pull/1324
- Remove the generic from wallet https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/pull/1387
  - Changed PersistenceBackend errors to depend on the anyhow crate
  - Remove the generic T from Wallet
- Improve address API https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/pull/1402
  - Added Wallet methods:
    - peek_address
    - reveal_next_address
    - next_unused_address
    - reveal_addresses_to
    - list_unused_addresses
    - mark_used
    - unmark_used
  - Removed Wallet methods:
    - get_address
    - get_internal_address
    - try_get_address
    - try_get_internal_address
- Simplified EsploraExt API https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/pull/1380
  - Changed EsploraExt API so that sync only requires one round of fetching data. The local_chain_update method is removed and the local_tip parameter is added to the full_scan and sync methods.
  - Removed TxGraph::missing_heights and tx_graph::ChangeSet::missing_heights_from methods.
  - Introduced CheckPoint::insert which allows convenient checkpoint-insertion. This is intended for use by chain-sources when crafting an update.
  - Refactored merge_chains to also return the resultant CheckPoint tip.
  - Optimized the update LocalChain logic - use the update CheckPoint as the new CheckPoint tip when possible.
- Introduce `bdk-persist` crate https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/pull/1412
- Introduce universal sync/full-scan structures for spk-based syncing #1413
  - Add universal structures for initiating/receiving sync/full-scan requests/results for spk-based syncing.
  - Updated bdk_esplora chain-source to make use of new universal sync/full-scan structures.

## [v1.0.0-alpha.9]

### Summary

This regular bi-weekly alpha release updates dependencies rust-bitcoin to v0.31.0 and rust-miniscript to v11.0.0 plus replaces the deprecated rust-miniscript function max_satisfaction_weight with max_weight_to_satisfy. It also adds chain module improvements needed to simplify syncing with electrum and esplora blockchain clients.

### Fixed

* Replace the deprecated max_satisfaction_weight from rust-miniscript to max_weight_to_satisfy. #1345

### Changed

* Update dependencies: rust-bitcoin to v0.31.0 and rust-miniscript to v11.0.0. #1177
* Changed TxGraph to store transactions as Arc<Transaction>. This allows chain-sources to cheaply keep a copy of already-fetched transactions.  #1373
* Add get and range methods to CheckPoint #1369
  * Added get and range methods to CheckPoint (and in turn, LocalChain). This simulates an API where we have implemented a skip list of checkpoints (to implement in the future). This is a better API because we can query for any height or height range with just a checkpoint tip instead of relying on a separate checkpoint index (which needs to live in LocalChain).
  * Changed LocalChain to have a faster Eq implementation. We now maintain an xor value of all checkpoint block hashes. We compare this xor value to determine whether two chains are equal.
  * Added PartialEq implementation for CheckPoint and local_chain::Update.
* Methods into_tx_graph and into_confirmation_time_tx_graph for RelevantTxids are changed to no longer accept a seen_at parameter. #1385
  * Added method update_last_seen_unconfirmed for TxGraph.
* Added proptest for CheckPoint::range. #1397

## [v1.0.0-alpha.8]

### Summary

This incremental bi-weekly release migrates API to use the rust-bitcoin FeeRate type, fixes PSBT finalization to remove extra taproot fields, and fixes blockchain scanning stop_gap definition and documentation. We recommend all 1.0.0-alpha users upgrade to this release.

### Fixed

### Changed

- Migrate to bitcoin::FeeRate #1216
- chore: extract TestEnv into separate crate #1171

## [v1.0.0-alpha.7]

### Summary

### Fixed

- Fix `KeychainTxOutIndex::lookahead_to_target` to look ahead to correct index.  #1349

### Changed

- Relax the generic requirements on `TxBuilder`. #1312

## [v1.0.0-alpha.6]

### Summary

This small bi-weekly release fixes TxBuilder to support setting explicit nSequence for foreign inputs and a bug in tx_graph::ChangeSet::is_empty where is returns true even when it wasn't empty ðŸ™ˆ.  We also added a new option for Esplora APIs to include floating TxOuts in pudates for fee calculations.

### Fixed

- `CheckPoint::from_block_ids` convenience method. #1172
- `LocalChain` methods to apply a block header (`apply_header` and `apply_header_connected_to`). #1172
- Test to show that `LocalChain` can apply updates that are shorter than original. This will happen during reorgs if we sync wallet with `bdk_bitcoind_rpc::Emitter`. #1172

## [v1.0.0-alpha.4]

### Summary

This release improves the `KeychainTxOutIndex` API and contains a few bug fixes and performance improvements.

### Fixed

- Avoid using `BTreeMap::append` due to performance issues (refer to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/34666#issuecomment-675658420). #1274

### Changed

- The old `hardwaresigner` module has been moved out of `bdk` and inside a new `bdk_hwi` crate. #1161
- Wallet's peek-address logic is optimized by making use of `<SpkIterator as Iterator>::nth`. #1269
- `KeychainTxOutIndex` API is refactored to better differentiate between methods that return unbounded vs stored spks. #1269
- `KeychainTxOutIndex` no longer directly exposes `SpkTxOutIndex` methods via `DeRef`. This was problematic because `SpkTxOutIndex` also contains lookahead spks which we want to hide. #1269

### Added

- LocalChain::disconnect_from method to evict a chain of blocks starting from a given BlockId. #1276
- `SpkIterator::descriptor` method which gets a reference to the internal descriptor. #1269

## [v1.0.0-alpha.3]

### Summary

This release changes LocalChain to have a hard-wired genesis block, adds context specific Wallet TxBuilder errors, and bumps the projects MSRV to 1.63. It also includes other API and docs improvements and bug fixes, see the changelog for all the details.

### Fixed

- Further improve unconfirmed tx conflict resolution. #1109
- Stuck Electrum chain sync issue. #1145
- Bug related to taproot signing with internal keys. We would previously sign with the first private key we had, without checking if it was the correct internal key or not. #1200
- Coinbase transactions cannot exist in the mempool and be unconfirmed. TxGraph::try_get_chain_position should always return None for coinbase transactions not anchored in best chain. #1202
- Esplora incorrect gap limit check in blocking client. #1225
- Loading a wallet from persistence now restores keychain indices. #1246

### Changed

- Rename ConfirmationTimeAnchor to ConfirmationTimeHeightAnchor. #1206
- New LocalChain now have a hardwired genesis block: #1178
  - Changed ChainOracle::get_chain_tip method to return a BlockId instead of an Option of a BlockId.
  - Refactored LocalChain so that the genesis BlockId is hardwired. This way, the ChainOracle::get_chain_tip implementation can always return a tip.
  - Add is_empty method to PersistBackend. This returns true when there is no data in the persistence.
  - Changed Wallet::new to initialize a fresh wallet only.
  - Added Wallet::load to restore an instance of a wallet.
  - Replaced Store::new with separate methods to create/open the database file.
- Updated the bdk module to use new context specific error types: #1028
  - wallet: MiniscriptPsbtError, CreateTxError, BuildFeeBumpError error enums.
  - coin_selection: module Error enum.
- Renamed fallible Wallet address functions to try_get_address() and try_get_internal_address(). #1028
- Rename LocalUtxo to LocalOutput. #1190
- MSRV is now 1.63.0 for bdk, chain, and bitcoind_rpc crates. #1183
- Use a universal lookahead value for KeychainTxOutIndex and have a reasonable default. #1229
- Return NonEmptyDatabase error when constructing a wallet with Wallet::new if the file already contains data (in which case, the caller should use load or new_or_load). #1256
- In electrum_ext rename functions scan_without_keychain to sync and scan to full_scan. #1235
- In esplora_ext rename functions scan_txs to sync and scan_txs_with_keychains to full_scan. #1235
- Increase rust-bip39 dependency version to 2.0 #1259

### Removed

- Removed catch-all top level bdk::Error enum. #1028
- Removed impl_error macro. #1028

### Added

- Add infallible Wallet get_address and get_internal_address functions. #1028
- Add Wallet::list_output method. #1190

- Change the meaning of the `fee_amount` field inside `CoinSelectionResult`: from now on the `fee_amount` will represent only the fees associated with the utxos in the `selected` field of `CoinSelectionResult`.
- New `RpcBlockchain` implementation with various fixes.
- Return balance in separate categories, namely `confirmed`, `trusted_pending`, `untrusted_pending` & `immature`.

## [v0.20.0]

### Sync API change

To decouple the `Wallet` from the `Blockchain` we've made major changes:

- Removed `Blockchain` from Wallet.
- Removed `Wallet::broadcast` (just use `Blockchain::broadcast`)

- Stop making a request for the block height when calling `Wallet:new`.
- Added `SyncOptions` to capture extra (future) arguments to `Wallet::sync`.
- Removed `max_addresses` sync parameter which determined how many addresses to cache before syncing since this can just be done with `ensure_addresses_cached`.
- remove `flush` method from the `Database` trait.

## [v0.10.0]

- Added `RpcBlockchain` in the `AnyBlockchain` struct to allow using Rpc backend where `AnyBlockchain` is used (eg `bdk-cli`)
- Removed hard dependency on `tokio`.

### Wallet

- Removed and replaced `set_single_recipient` with more general `drain_to` and replaced `maintain_single_recipient` with `allow_shrinking`.

### Blockchain

- Removed `stop_gap` from `Blockchain` trait and added it to only `ElectrumBlockchain` and `EsploraBlockchain` structs.

#### Added
- Added `get_address(AddressIndex::LastUnused)` which returns the last derived address if it has not been used or if used in a received transaction returns a new address
- Added `get_address(AddressIndex::Peek(u32))` which returns a derived address for a specified descriptor index but does not change the current index
- Added `get_address(AddressIndex::Reset(u32))` which returns a derived address for a specified descriptor index and resets current index to the given value
- Added `get_psbt_input` to create the corresponding psbt input for a local utxo.
